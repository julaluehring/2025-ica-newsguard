## How to measure misinformation?

::: {.column width="50%"}

Misinformation is hard to detect due to

    -   subtle & grey-area content

    -   ethical complexity
        
    -   conceptual/methodological constraints & traditions

Source-based methods have the advantage to

    -   include grey-are content 

    -   easier to make judgments
        
    -   scalable

## NewsGuard

* data base of ~12,000 news domains rated for trustworthiness (0–100)

* selected based on web data and evaluated using 9 journalistic quality criteria  $\rightarrow$ *accurate at scale*

* ratings are updated regularly by country experts

* initially US-focused, now including other countries

::: fragment 
++ NewsGuard is the most comprehensive list of source ratings & widely used (in Science & nature)

--- it's not reproducible, and we can't validate it

## Research goals

1. assess stability and completeness of ratings over time and countries

2. evaluate the value of additional labels (e.g., political orientation, topics)

3. provide recommendations for research use

## Stability over time

![](images/trustworthiness.png){width="500"}

* trustworthiness is relatively stable (changes rare, avg. 2 yrs)

* drops due to new low-trustworthiness sources being added

## Country-level completeness

* majority of sources are US-based (~76%)

* trustworthiness scores vary by country (US lowest on avg.)

* stable coverage reached by ~2022 for US, DE, FR, IT, CA

![](images/convergence.png){width="500"}

## Use of contextual labels 

::: columns

::: {.column width="60%"}

* political orientation label (right/left) sparse (~33%, mostly US)

* right-leaning sources score lower on average

* most sources have useful topic label (e.g., "health", "politics")

:::

## Replication findings

* continuous scores: stable results across time

* binary labels: can distort trends (e.g., spike in “untrustworthy” links from Republicans post-2020)

## Recommendations

1. always prefer continuous over binary scores

2. use annual snapshots after first stable state and check for major source additions/removals

3. check for country-specific journalistic traditions, esp. for comparative research

4. topic and orientation labels are useful to characterize sources beyond trustworthiness but should be validated (or at least spot-checked)

::: notes
Coverage: Be cautious for countries other than those mentioned above, as coverage may be incomplete.

Stability: The overall score rarely changes a lot, but coverage does. When using temporal data, check for major additions or removals (or use an annual snapshot).

Country differences: Countries have different journalistic traditions, which we can see in the criteria for rating trustworthiness. Check if they make sense for the context you’re studying (esp. for comparative research). 

Binary trustworthiness ratings: True/false labels for trustworthiness can be volatile across time periods and may distort downstream research. We strongly recommend using continuous scores whenever possible.

Look beyond trustworthiness: NG provides additional contextual data, like political orientation and topic labels. Such labels are incomplete but useful to better characterize sources beyond trustworthiness.

## Implications for source-based approaches

* binary true/false labels can be volatile across time periods

* coverage & ratings are relatively insensitive to time once it reaches a stable state, speaking for the reliability of source-based approaches

* need more open, transparent alternatives
